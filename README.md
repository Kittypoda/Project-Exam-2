# Holidaze 

Welcome to **Holidaze** ‚Äì a modern and visually clean venue booking platform, developed as my final exam project in the Front-End Development program at Noroff.

This project challenged me to think holistically about both user experience and technical implementation, with a clear focus on accessibility, responsiveness, and role-based functionality. The goal was to create a booking system that feels easy to use, inspiring to explore, and trustworthy to interact with.

Holidaze is designed for three user types:
- **Guests** (unregistered users who can browse and explore)
- **Travelers** (logged-in users who can book stays)
- **Venue Managers** (hosts who can list and manage their own venues)

Throughout the project, I‚Äôve worked with structured components in React, used Tailwind CSS to build a consistent visual identity, and connected to an external API to handle bookings, listings, and user logic.

Below, you‚Äôll find more information about the tech stack, features, and setup.
